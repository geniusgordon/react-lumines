  - ‚úÖ Performance Tracking: FPS monitoring and frame skip protection
  - ‚úÖ State Management: Start/pause/resume functionality
  - ‚úÖ Debug Mode: Manual frame stepping for debugging deterministic behavior
  - ‚úÖ Debug Logging: Comprehensive action and state change logging in debug mode
  - ‚úÖ Debug Component: Extracted DebugPanel component for modular debug UI
- **Input System**: Complete keyboard input handling with replay support
  - ‚úÖ useControls: Keyboard input capture with configurable key mappings
  - ‚úÖ Action Mapping: All game controls (move, rotate, drop, pause) mapped to game actions
  - ‚úÖ Replay Recording: Deterministic input recording with frame timestamps
  - ‚úÖ State-Aware Controls: Different input handling based on game state (start/playing/paused/gameOver)
  - ‚úÖ Debug Integration: Input system respects debug mode for testing
  - ‚úÖ Key Repeat: Optional key repeat functionality with configurable timing
  - ‚úÖ Cleanup: Proper event listener and timer cleanup on unmount
- **Block Mechanics**: Complete falling block system
  - ‚úÖ Block Falling: Automatic dropping every 48 frames (~0.8s at 60 FPS)
  - ‚úÖ Collision Detection: Blocks stop when hitting board bottom or other blocks
  - ‚úÖ Block Placement: Automatic placement when blocks can't fall further
  - ‚úÖ Movement & Rotation: Left/right movement and clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation
  - ‚úÖ Soft/Hard Drop: Manual dropping with S key and Space/Down arrow
  - ‚úÖ Queue System: 3-block preview queue with automatic generation
  - ‚úÖ Spawn Position: New blocks spawn at top center (7,0) position
  - ‚úÖ Deterministic Behavior: All block operations use seeded RNG for consistent results
- **Core Gameplay**: Complete Lumines gameplay mechanics
  - ‚úÖ Rectangle Detection: Flood-fill algorithm finds same-colored rectangles (2x2 minimum)

### Known Issues

- None - all core systems working correctly with 85/85 tests passing

### Evolution of Decisions

#### Initial Scope

- Started with comprehensive PRD covering all requirements
- Emphasized deterministic gameplay and replay functionality
- Chose React functional components with hooks architecture

#### Technical Architecture

- Selected useReducer for complex state management
- Committed to integer-only positioning for determinism
- Planned custom hooks for game logic separation
- Decided on fixed 60 FPS timestep approach

#### Development Strategy

- Documentation-first approach with complete memory bank
- Component-driven development using Storybook
- TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- No external game engine dependencies

#### Input System Design

- Frame-based input timing for deterministic replay
- Configurable key mappings with multiple keys per action
- State-aware input handling for different game modes
- Recording system built-in for replay functionality

#### Block Mechanics Implementation

- Fixed drop interval (48 frames) for consistent gameplay timing
- Collision detection using grid-based validation
- Automatic block placement with queue management
- Smooth integration with debug logging system

## Success Metrics
