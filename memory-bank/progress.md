### Known Issues

- **Core Lumines Mechanics Partial**: Pattern detection implemented ✅, marking and timeline-based clearing still needed
- **Scoring Tests**: All scoring tests marked as TODO in gameLogic.test.ts (but pattern detection works)

### Evolution of Decisions

#### Initial Scope

- Started with comprehensive PRD covering all requirements
- Emphasized deterministic gameplay and replay functionality
- Chose React functional components with hooks architecture

#### Technical Architecture

- Selected useReducer for complex state management
- Committed to integer-only positioning for determinism
- Planned custom hooks for game logic separation
- Decided on fixed 60 FPS timestep approach

#### Development Strategy

- Documentation-first approach with complete memory bank
- Component-driven development using Storybook
- TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- No external game engine dependencies

#### Input System Design

- Frame-based input timing for deterministic replay
- Configurable key mappings with multiple keys per action
- State-aware input handling for different game modes
- Recording system built-in for replay functionality

#### Block Mechanics Implementation

- Fixed drop interval (48 frames) for consistent gameplay timing
- Collision detection using grid-based validation
- Automatic block placement with queue management
- Smooth integration with debug logging system

## Current Focus: The Timeline Rhythm

### What Makes Lumines Unique

The core mechanic that differentiates Lumines from other puzzle games:

1. **Instant Pattern Marking**: Same-colored 2×2+ regions get marked immediately
2. **Delayed Clearing**: Marked patterns only clear when the timeline sweep passes through them
3. **Strategic Timing**: Players must think about WHERE the timeline will be, not just pattern formation
4. **Rhythm Element**: Creates anticipation and timing-based strategy

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Pattern Detection**: Flood-fill algorithm to find connected same-colored regions ≥ 2×2
2. **Marking System**: Visual indication of marked patterns (keep them on board)
3. **Timeline Integration**: Clear marked patterns only when sweep passes through
4. **Simple Scoring**: 1 point per 2×2 square cleared (no complex formulas)

## Success Metrics
