## Current Status Details

### What Works

- **Project Structure**: Clean, organized codebase with proper component hierarchy
- **Documentation**: Complete understanding of requirements and architecture
- **Development Environment**: Vite + TypeScript + Storybook working
- **Build System**: Fast development server and production builds
- **Visual Components**: Complete rendering system for game elements
  - ‚úÖ GridCell: Individual board squares with color states
  - ‚úÖ Block: 2x2 tetromino pieces with positioning
  - ‚úÖ GameBoard: 16x10 grid with timeline sweep
  - ‚úÖ Dark Theme: Professional color scheme with animations
  - ‚úÖ Demo App: Visual showcase of all components working together
- **Game Loop**: Fixed timestep game loop with deterministic updates
  - ‚úÖ useGameLoop: 60 FPS fixed timestep hook with frame counting
  - ‚úÖ Integration: Working with game reducer and state management
  - ‚úÖ Performance Tracking: FPS monitoring and frame skip protection
  - ‚úÖ State Management: Start/pause/resume functionality
  - ‚úÖ Debug Mode: Manual frame stepping for debugging deterministic behavior
  - ‚úÖ Debug Logging: Comprehensive action and state change logging in debug mode

### Known Issues

- None yet - project just initialized

### Evolution of Decisions

#### Initial Scope

- Started with comprehensive PRD covering all requirements
- Emphasized deterministic gameplay and replay functionality
- Chose React functional components with hooks architecture

#### Technical Architecture

- Selected useReducer for complex state management
- Committed to integer-only positioning for determinism
- Planned custom hooks for game logic separation
- Decided on fixed 60 FPS timestep approach

#### Development Strategy

- Documentation-first approach with complete memory bank
- Component-driven development using Storybook
- TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- No external game engine dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals

- [ ] Maintains consistent 60 FPS during gameplay
- [ ] Zero input lag on modern browsers
- [ ] 100% deterministic behavior (same seed = same game)
- [ ] Replay system produces identical results

### Gameplay Goals

- [ ] Accurate rectangle detection and clearing
- [ ] Smooth block movement and rotation
- [ ] Satisfying timeline sweep animation
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all actions

### Code Quality Goals

- [ ] Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- [ ] Comprehensive component documentation in Storybook
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code architecture
- [ ] Efficient rendering with minimal re-renders

## Risk Assessment
