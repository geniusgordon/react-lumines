# Game Reducer Tests

This directory contains organized test suites for the game reducer functionality. The tests have been broken down into focused modules for better maintainability and readability.

## Test Organization

### üìÅ File Structure

- **`gameReducer.basic.test.ts`** - Core functionality tests (15 tests)
- **`gameReducer.movement.test.ts`** - Block movement and control tests (14 tests)  
- **`gameReducer.gameplay.test.ts`** - Gameplay mechanics tests (18 tests)
- **`gameReducer.timeline.test.ts`** - Timeline processing tests (14 tests)

### üé® Visual Board Diagrams

Many tests include ASCII art diagrams to visualize board states, making it easier to understand:
- **Pattern layouts** - Shows 2x2 squares and larger rectangles
- **Collision scenarios** - Displays blocked movement situations  
- **Timeline processing** - Illustrates which columns contain patterns
- **Gravity effects** - Shows before/after states of falling blocks
- **Game over conditions** - Visualizes blocked spawn scenarios

Example diagram format:
```
/*
 * Board layout (showing only relevant area):
 *     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 * 0   . . . . . . . . . .
 * 1   . . . . . . . . . .
 * ...
 * 8   . . . . . 1 1 . . .  ‚Üê 2x2 pattern
 * 9   . . . . . 1 1 . . .  ‚Üê 2x2 pattern
 *               ‚Üë
 *         pattern at (5,8)

```

### üß™ Test Categories

#### Basic Functionality (`gameReducer.basic.test.ts`)
- Initial state creation and validation
- Game flow actions (start, pause, resume, restart, game over)
- Debug mode toggling
- Error handling and edge cases
- State immutability guarantees

#### Block Movement (`gameReducer.movement.test.ts`)
- Left/right movement with boundary detection
- Clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation
- Soft drop and hard drop mechanics
- Collision detection
- Game state validation for movement actions

#### Gameplay Mechanics (`gameReducer.gameplay.test.ts`)
- Game tick progression and timing
- Automatic block dropping
- Timeline movement and wrapping
- Gravity application
- Pattern detection (2x2 squares, larger rectangles)
- Block placement and queue management

#### Timeline Processing (`gameReducer.timeline.test.ts`)
- Column-by-column timeline processing
- Pattern marking and score accumulation
- Cell clearing logic with timing constraints
- Complex clearing scenarios
- Timeline edge cases and wrapping
- Variable timeline speeds

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all reducer tests
npm test -- src/reducers/__tests__/

# Run specific test category
npm test -- src/reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.basic.test.ts
npm test -- src/reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.movement.test.ts
npm test -- src/reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.gameplay.test.ts
npm test -- src/reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.timeline.test.ts
```

## Test Coverage

This organization makes it easier to:
- Navigate to relevant tests for specific functionality
- Add new tests in logical groupings
- Maintain and update test suites
- Debug specific game mechanics
- Onboard new developers to the codebase
