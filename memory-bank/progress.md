### üöß In Progress
- Currently in initialization phase
- Ready to begin core development

### ‚è≥ To Do

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Next)
- [ ] Type definitions (`src/types/game.ts`)
- [ ] Game constants (`src/constants/gameConfig.ts`)
- [ ] SeededRNG class implementation
- [ ] Basic game state structure
- [ ] useReducer setup for state management

#### Phase 2: Visual Components
- [ ] GameBoard component (16x10 grid)
- [ ] Block component (2x2 tetromino)
- [ ] GridCell component (individual squares)
- [ ] Basic CSS styling
- [ ] Color scheme implementation

#### Phase 3: Game Loop & Controls
- [ ] useGameLoop hook (fixed 60 FPS)
- [ ] useControls hook (keyboard input)
- [ ] Block falling mechanics
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Basic movement and rotation

#### Phase 4: Core Gameplay
- [ ] Rectangle detection algorithm
- [ ] Timeline sweep implementation
- [ ] Rectangle clearing logic
- [ ] Gravity system (blocks fall after clearing)
- [ ] Scoring system

#### Phase 5: Game States
- [ ] Start screen
- [ ] Game over screen  
- [ ] Pause functionality
- [ ] Score display
- [ ] Next block preview

#### Phase 6: Replay System
- [ ] Input recording during gameplay
- [ ] Replay data serialization
- [ ] Replay playback functionality
- [ ] Save/load replay files
- [ ] Replay verification system

#### Phase 7: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Animation polish
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Replay system validation

## Current Status Details

### What Works
- **Project Structure**: Clean, organized codebase ready for development
- **Documentation**: Complete understanding of requirements and architecture
- **Development Environment**: Vite + TypeScript + Storybook working
- **Build System**: Fast development server and production builds

### Known Issues
- None yet - project just initialized

### Evolution of Decisions

#### Initial Scope
- Started with comprehensive PRD covering all requirements
- Emphasized deterministic gameplay and replay functionality
- Chose React functional components with hooks architecture

#### Technical Architecture
- Selected useReducer for complex state management
- Committed to integer-only positioning for determinism
- Planned custom hooks for game logic separation
- Decided on fixed 60 FPS timestep approach

#### Development Strategy
- Documentation-first approach with complete memory bank
- Component-driven development using Storybook
- TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- No external game engine dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- [ ] Maintains consistent 60 FPS during gameplay
- [ ] Zero input lag on modern browsers
- [ ] 100% deterministic behavior (same seed = same game)
- [ ] Replay system produces identical results

### Gameplay Goals
- [ ] Accurate rectangle detection and clearing
- [ ] Smooth block movement and rotation
- [ ] Satisfying timeline sweep animation
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all actions

### Code Quality Goals
- [ ] Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- [ ] Comprehensive component documentation in Storybook
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code architecture
- [ ] Efficient rendering with minimal re-renders

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- React/TypeScript development experience
- Component architecture design
- Basic game loop implementation
- UI/UX design and styling

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Fixed timestep timing precision in browser
- Rectangle detection algorithm efficiency
- State management complexity
- Performance optimization

### High Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
